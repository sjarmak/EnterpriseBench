# check_expected_values.sh — checkpoint "determine_expected_values"
#
# Grades DRIFT_REPORT.json against ground_truth.json:drift_points (sealed
# root-only), curated from argo-cd PR #22035 / issue #22034 and verified by
# parsing both values.yaml files at the pinned SHAs.
#
# The old check scored two greps over the whole report: one for
# "remove"/"delete"/"omit"/"upstream default", one for "3.17"/"strict"/
# "validation"/"tighten". instruction.md supplied every one of those words — it
# asked "Should the override exist at all, or should it be removed to let the
# upstream default apply?" and named Helm 3.17.1 four times — so the checkpoint
# was satisfiable by restating the question, with no repo access.
#
# It also inverted the grade. A correct answer states the upstream default as a
# fact ("the upstream chart defaults this key to {runAsUser: 1000, ...}"), which
# contains none of those words, so it scored 0.0 here while a prompt echo scored
# 1.0. That is why a correct report totalled 0.4625 and a fabricated one 0.8125.
#
# The expected value must now be the concrete upstream default the null override
# displaces, quoted from the upstream chart. instruction.md asks for exactly that
# ("the real default as it appears in the upstream chart, not a description of
# it"), and "runtimedefault", "allowprivilegeescalation", "runasuser" and "1000"
# each appear ZERO times in it — reading dandydeveloper-charts is the only way to
# obtain them.
#
# "runasuser"/"1000" is also what separates the two drift points: the upstream
# haproxy.containerSecurityContext table has NO runAsUser, while the top-level
# containerSecurityContext sets runAsUser: 1000. So a report that finds one
# drift point cannot collect the other's credit by naming the same key twice.
