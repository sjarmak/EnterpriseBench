# check_drift_points.sh — checkpoint "identify_drift_points"
#
# Grades DRIFT_REPORT.json against ground_truth.json:drift_points, which is
# sealed root-only and was curated from bitnami/charts PR #33114 and verified
# against the template at the pinned SHA.
#
# What changed and why: this check used to credit a drift point whose file/key
# merely mentioned "serflan" or "serfwan". instruction.md hands the agent both
# port names, the service name and the file list, so a DRIFT_REPORT.json
# fabricated from the prompt alone -- no repo access -- scored 1.0 here (and
# 1.0 on both siblings: the whole task was solvable from its own prompt). The
# md-echo gate could not see it: a `cp instruction.md` copy is not valid JSON,
# so json.load threw and the check "passed" at 0.0 (EnterpriseBench-jn73.2.7.3.1.4).
#
# So identification now requires the swap DIRECTION, which exists only in the
# template: each drift point must name the wrong expression it currently
# resolves to. Of the graded tokens, "containerports" and "serfwan-udp" appear
# ZERO times in instruction.md -- the prompt names only serflan-udp, so an agent
# that has not read the template does not know the second UDP entry drifted at
# all, nor that the values key is containerPorts.
