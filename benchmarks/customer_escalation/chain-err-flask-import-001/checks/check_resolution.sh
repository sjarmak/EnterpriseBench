# check_resolution.sh — checkpoint "resolution_correct"
#
# Grades the DECISION, not a diff. This was check_fix.sh, which awarded its full
# weight for (a) a FIX_SUMMARY.md over 50 bytes and (b) any *.py file showing up in
# the workspace repo's diff against HEAD~1 — bare changed-file membership. It could
# not tell a fix from a comment because it never read the code's meaning, so one
# comment appended to tests/conftest.py paid 0.40 (EnterpriseBench-uc12m / -e4w15).
#
# The correct resolution is that NO code change is warranted: the reported cycle
# does not exist, so there is nothing to break, and patching working code to defer
# an import that is already absent would add risk and fix nothing. Because the
# decision is the deliverable, no diff is graded at all — that is what removes the
# comment vector, rather than tightening a match that was never measuring the fix.
#
# The decision GATES the evidence rather than scoring beside it: a wrong decision is
# 0 outright, and a right one earns only what its reason can evidence. So guessing
# "no change" — which the escalation pressure in session 2 invites — pays nothing on
# its own.
#
# The verdict gates it too, for the same reason and against a sharper vector. `reason`
# is free text, so ANY token rule over it is dump-payable: the sole token for this
# checkpoint (type_checking) sits in the first eight lines of src/flask/globals.py, so
# pasting that file into `reason` with code_change_required=false scored 1.0 — 0.30 of
# the task for a file copy plus a coin flip. Retokenizing cannot fix that (a multi-file
# cat pays any token drawn from source; measured), and the decision is only one bit, so
# it cannot carry the gate alone. Requiring the verdict to be right as well means the
# refusal to patch has to rest on an investigation that actually landed
# (EnterpriseBench-e4w15). See check_investigation.sh for the full reasoning and the
# enumerated cost.
#
# ground_truth.json is sealed root-only; the agent cannot read the key.

# flat /workspace/.verifiers/. A shared library outside checks/ is never copied (every
# check then breaks in-sandbox); one inside checks/ is copied, lands renamed, and
# test_runner.sh runs it AS a check at default weight 1.0 — pushing task_score above
# 1.0 and tripping test_every_check_is_claimed_by_a_checkpoint. Self-containment is

    check with concurrent swappers and forged a perfect 1.0 on ~22% of 1500 invocations,
    because CYCLE_VERDICT.json carries ground_truth.json exact schema, so a symlinked
    read of the sealed key IS a perfect verdict. Three flags close the window at open()
    time, where there is nothing to race:
      O_NOFOLLOW  a symlink swapped in raises instead of reading the target.
      O_NONBLOCK  a FIFO swapped in returns instead of blocking the read until a writer
                  appears — a hang becomes a verifier_timeout, i.e. a no-verdict route
                  the agent can trigger for a free re-run.
      fstat S_ISREG  a FIFO, device or directory (which O_NOFOLLOW alone lets through)

                  O_NONBLOCK for reads, so this is a no-op on the honest case.

    broken grader.

    These guards live in python, not in the bash preamble beside the others, so the

    validated, so a corrupt key plus a missing verdict returned a plain
    {"score": 0.0} instead of VERIFIER_INFRA_ERROR — a broken grader recorded as a real
    agent failure, which is the one thing the scoring trust boundary forbids. Measured
