#
#   * It reads nothing but agent_output/. run_task.py plants
#     /workspace/instruction.md and chowns it to the agent, so a scan of
#     $WORKSPACE grades the question as the answer — a no-op agent scored 1.00.
#   * It matches answer-key paths, never prompt vocabulary. instruction.md
#     describes the bug in prose and names no files, and ground_truth.json is
#     sealed root-only (run_task.py GRADING_PATHS), so the paths below are
#     reachable only by an agent that actually read the repo. Grepping for
#     tokens the prompt supplies would credit an echo of the prompt.
