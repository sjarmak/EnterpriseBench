# Incident: Informers Miss Events After Receiving DELETE Watch Event

## Alert

SRE team has identified a subtle data consistency issue: Kubernetes informers occasionally get stuck with a stale resourceVersion after processing DELETE watch events, causing them to miss subsequent changes.

## Symptoms

- After receiving a DELETE event from a namespace-scoped watch, the informer's tracked resourceVersion jumps backwards
- If the watch connection drops and is re-established, events between the stale and current resourceVersion are permanently missed
- This affects any namespace-scoped watch where objects can be modified to move between namespaces
- The issue does NOT occur when watching etcd directly (bypassing the watch cache)
- client-go informers are the primary affected consumers

## Reproduction Scenario

1. Establish a namespace-scoped watch via API server (watch cache enabled)
2. An object currently in the watched namespace is modified so it moves to a different namespace (or its labels change so it no longer matches the filter)
3. The watch cache correctly converts this to a DELETE event
4. Inspect the resourceVersion on the DELETE event -- it shows the old object's version, not the event's version
5. The etcd3 direct watcher handles this case correctly by copying the event resourceVersion onto the previous object

## Key Observation

The etcd3 watcher (`staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/storage/etcd3/watcher.go`) and the legacy etcd watcher (`staging/src/k8s.io/apiserver/pkg/storage/etcd/etcd_watcher.go`) both have logic to set the correct resourceVersion on delete events. The watch cache layer appears to be missing this logic.

## Environment

- Kubernetes v1.9.1
- The codebase is at `/workspace/kubernetes/`
- Focus on the API server's storage layer

## What I Need

1. **Root Cause**: Find the exact code in the watch cache filtering logic that sends PrevObject without updating its resourceVersion for DELETE events.

2. **Error Chain**: Trace the full path from a client-go informer watch through the API server to the watch cache event processing, and compare with the etcd direct watcher path.

3. **Affected Components**: What components are affected by this bug?

4. **Remediation**: How should the watch cache be fixed? Reference the existing correct implementations in the etcd watchers.

## Output

Write your findings to `/workspace/kubernetes/INCIDENT_REPORT.md`.
