# check_topo_order.sh — checkpoint "topological_order"
#
# Validates the proposed order against ground_truth.json:dependency_graph via
# the shared eb_verify topological_order plugin (plugin unchanged; three sibling
# tasks use it). What changed is the graph, and a gate in front of it.
#
# The graph was a four-deep staging cascade (apimachinery -> api -> client-go ->
# apiserver) rooted at a "build-infra" node, with "distroless-images" and
# "e2e-infra" hanging off it. Three of those seven nodes DO NOT EXIST — no such
# repo, module or directory is in the checkout — and the four that do need no
# work at all: a Go toolchain bump touches nothing under staging/src/. The graph
# is now the GOVERNS graph the repo declares about itself: build/dependencies.yaml
# carries a version plus a refPaths list per entry, so it lands first and its six
# refPath targets follow. See ground_truth.json:_premise_correction.
#
# Fixing the graph alone would leave free credit here, and this is the subtle
# part: resolve_tokens_to_graph drops tokens that are not graph nodes, so the old
# cascade resolves to nothing and scores 0.0 rather than being credited. But the
# asserted staging edges are REAL as Go module facts — client-go does require
# apimachinery — so an agent can "verify" the chain in a go.mod and still be
# wrong, having never checked whether a toolchain bump traverses it. The sequence
# alone cannot separate a derived plan from a recited one.
#
# The order is therefore gated on evidence it was DERIVED: the plan must name the
# manifest that declares the propagation set ('dependencies.yaml', ZERO hits in
# instruction.md). That is what makes the set knowable rather than guessable, and
# it is readable only in the checkout (EnterpriseBench-jn73.2.7.3.1.2).
