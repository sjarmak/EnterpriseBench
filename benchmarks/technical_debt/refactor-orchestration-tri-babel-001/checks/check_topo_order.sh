# check_topo_order.sh — checkpoint "topological_order"
#
# Validates the proposed order against ground_truth.json:dependency_graph via
# the shared eb_verify topological_order plugin (plugin unchanged; three sibling
# tasks use it). What changed is the graph, and a gate in front of it.
#
# The graph asserted webpack -> babel and next.js -> [babel, webpack]. Both
# babel edges are false: webpack v5.88.2 parses with acorn ^8.7.1 and declares no
# babel package in dependencies, so a Babel parser AST change never reaches it.
# The graph is now the change-propagation graph over the repos the change does
# reach: babel -> next.js. See ground_truth.json:_premise_correction.
#
# Fixing the graph alone would leave free credit here, and this is the subtle
# part: resolve_tokens_to_graph drops tokens that are not graph nodes, so a plan
# ordering [babel, webpack, next.js] — the old prompt's chain verbatim, and what
# any model that knows the JS toolchain guesses — resolves to [babel, next.js]
# and validates as a correct order. The sequence alone cannot separate a derived
# plan from a recited one.
#
# The order is therefore gated on evidence it was DERIVED: the plan must name
# what webpack actually parses with ('acorn', ZERO hits in instruction.md). That
# is the fact that dissolves the chain, and it is readable only in
# webpack/package.json (EnterpriseBench-jn73.2.7.3.1.2).
