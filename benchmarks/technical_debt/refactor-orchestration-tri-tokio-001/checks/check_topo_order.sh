# check_topo_order.sh — checkpoint "topological_order"
#
# Validates the proposed order against ground_truth.json:dependency_graph via
# the shared eb_verify topological_order plugin (plugin unchanged; three sibling
# tasks use it). What changed is the graph it validates against, and a gate in
# front of it.
#
# The graph was wrong. It asserted axum -> hyper, but axum 0.6.19 requires
# hyper ^0.14.24 while the workspace vendors hyper 1.0.0-rc.4 — semver
# incompatible, so that edge does not exist here. The real shape is a fan-out
# from tokio. See ground_truth.json:_premise_correction.
#
# Fixing the graph alone would leave this checkpoint as free credit, and this is
# the subtle part: under the CORRECTED fan-out graph, [tokio, hyper, axum] is
# still a valid topological order. It is also exactly what the old prompt stated
# outright, and what any model that knows the Rust async ecosystem guesses
# without opening a file. So the order alone cannot separate a derived plan from
# a recited one, and crediting it would hand 0.45 to a plan that never read the
# repos.
#
# The order is therefore gated on evidence that the graph was DERIVED: the plan
# must cite axum's actual hyper requirement (0.14.x), the fact that kills the
# assumed chain and is readable only in axum/Cargo.toml. "0.14" appears ZERO
# times in instruction.md, which now states no versions at all. Ungated, this
# check credits the ecosystem's reputation instead of the workspace's manifests
# (EnterpriseBench-jn73.2.7.3.1.2).
