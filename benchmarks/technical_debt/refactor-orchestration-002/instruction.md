# Refactor Orchestration: cobra v1.10 CLI Framework Bump

## Context

The spf13/cobra CLI framework v1.10.2 includes improved command suggestions and
bug fixes. Kubernetes uses cobra for kubectl and all control plane binaries
(kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler, kubelet).

## Task

Given these repositories at their pre-refactor state, produce a topologically
sorted execution plan for bumping cobra across the dependency chain.

## Repos in Workspace

- `/workspace/cobra/` — spf13/cobra v1.10.2 (upstream library)
- `/workspace/kubernetes/` — Kubernetes v1.33.0 (consumer)

## Expected Output

Write `/workspace/REFACTOR_PLAN.md` containing:

1. A numbered list of repos in the order they should be updated
2. Dependency graph (which repo depends on which)
3. Parallelization annotations (which steps can run concurrently)
4. Risk assessment per step
