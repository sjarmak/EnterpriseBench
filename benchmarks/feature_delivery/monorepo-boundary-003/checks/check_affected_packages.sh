#
# The old check grepped IMPACT_REPORT.md for 'babel.helpers|@babel/helpers',
# 'plugin.proposal.decorators|...' and 'babel.parser|@babel/parser' and scored
# found/3. instruction.md names @babel/parser, so a `cp instruction.md
# IMPACT_REPORT.md` copy scored 0.33 here for free. Those patterns are also
# unanchored regexes whose '.' matches any character — the exact trap that hides
# real leaks (EnterpriseBench-jn73.2.7.3.1.2); this check uses fixed strings.
#
# The premise is sound and was NOT re-scoped: @babel/helpers,
# @babel/plugin-proposal-decorators and @babel/parser really are the three
# affected packages, verified against the merged PRs. What was wrong is the
# ATTRIBUTION: the release notes claim (repeated by the old prompt and the old
# changed_package field) that the decorator core lands in
# @babel/helper-create-class-features-plugin. Neither PR touches it. That claim
# is what instruction.md now asks the agent to test, so refuting it is the
# finding and pure recall is not: the prompt supplies @babel/parser outright.
#
# Credit requires 'applyDecs2305' (ZERO hits in instruction.md now that the
# helper name has been removed from it) and then pays for the refutation plus the
# two packages the prompt never names.
