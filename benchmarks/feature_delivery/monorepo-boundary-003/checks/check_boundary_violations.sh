# check_boundary_violations.sh — checkpoint "identify_boundary_violations"
#
# The old check grepped for 'applyDecs2305', 'transformer-2023-05' and
# 'typescript/index' and scored found/3. The scored set is right — those are the
# three files where these two features cross package boundaries — but the old
# instruction.md handed one of them over: "The core change is in
# @babel/helper-create-class-features-plugin, with a new helper (applyDecs2305)".
# A `cp instruction.md IMPACT_REPORT.md` copy scored 0.33 here for free.
#
# The helper name has been removed from instruction.md, so all three targets now
# have ZERO hits in it and each one costs a read of the checkout. That is why
# this checkpoint carries no separate evidence gate in ground_truth.json: its
# scored tokens ARE the evidence, and gating a checkpoint on the token it already
# scores would be circular (EnterpriseBench-jn73.2.7.3.1.2).
#
# Fixed strings, never a regex: an unanchored '.' matches hyphens and slashes and
# hides real leaks.
