# Impact Analysis: retainLines Fix + for-of iterableIsArray Fix

## Context

We're cutting a v7.23.6 patch release with two independent bug fixes:

1. **retainLines indentation** — `@babel/generator`'s `printer.ts` had a bug where indentation was incorrectly calculated when the `retainLines` option was enabled. Fixed now.

2. **for-of iterableIsArray** — `@babel/plugin-transform-for-of` had a bug where the `iterableIsArray` assumption broke when the loop variable was shadowed in an inner scope. The fix is in the plugin's `src/index.ts`.

Both are straightforward fixes, but before we ship the patch I want to make sure there are no wider impacts across the monorepo — especially in `@babel/preset-env` which bundles both of these.

## What I Need

1. **Affected packages**: Beyond the two source packages, what else in the monorepo is touched? Check preset-env integration tests particularly.

2. **Impact classification**: Per package — these should all be patch-level, but confirm.

3. **Boundary violations**: Show me the integration test fixtures and any other files that exercise these behaviors across package boundaries.

## Output

Write findings to `/workspace/babel/IMPACT_REPORT.md`.
