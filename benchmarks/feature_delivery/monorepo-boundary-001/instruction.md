# Impact Analysis: TSPropertySignature.initializer Removal

## Context

Hey team — we're preparing the v7.23.6 patch release and one of the changes removes the `initializer` field from the `TSPropertySignature` AST node in `@babel/types`. The change is in `packages/babel-types/src/definitions/typescript.ts`.

Before we ship, I need a thorough impact analysis across the monorepo. TypeScript interface properties shouldn't have initializers (that's a class thing), so we're cleaning up the AST, but I want to make sure we haven't missed anything.

## What I Need

1. **Affected packages**: Which sibling packages in the babel monorepo reference `TSPropertySignature` and specifically its `initializer` field? Check the parser, generator, and any other packages that work with this node type.

2. **Impact classification**: For each affected package, tell me:
   - Is this a **major** break (public API change)?
   - A **minor** change (new feature/behavior)?
   - A **patch** fix (internal adjustment only)?
   - Or **none** (not actually affected)?

3. **Boundary violations**: Show me the specific files and code locations where the `initializer` field is referenced, consumed, or tested. I need to know what exactly needs updating.

## Output

Write your findings to `/workspace/babel/IMPACT_REPORT.md` with sections for each affected package including file paths, impact classification, and specific code references.
