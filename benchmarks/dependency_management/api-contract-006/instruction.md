# Impact Analysis: Envoy xDS v2 API Deprecation

## Context

The Envoy project is removing xDS v2 API support. As of v1.18, the v2 transport API is fatal-by-default — Envoy rejects v2 xDS requests. Our stack uses istio as the control plane, which communicates with Envoy sidecars via the go-control-plane library.

We need to understand the full migration path: envoy → go-control-plane → istio.

## What I Need

1. **Envoy changes**: What exactly is being deprecated? Which xDS v2 proto types and API versions are affected? What's the enforcement mechanism (warning → fatal → removed)?

2. **go-control-plane impact**: The library maintains v2 and v3 package trees (e.g., `pkg/cache/v2/` vs `pkg/cache/`). Which v2 packages need to be removed and what's the v3 equivalent?

3. **istio impact**: Find all files in istio's pilot component that reference v2 xDS types — Cluster, Endpoint, Listener, Route discovery services. These all need to migrate to v3 equivalents.

4. **Dependency chain**: Map the three-repo propagation chain. How do envoy's proto definitions flow through go-control-plane's Go bindings into istio's pilot implementation?

## Output

Write your findings to `/workspace/analysis/IMPACT_REPORT.md` with per-repo file lists, the dependency chain diagram, and migration priority (which files to migrate first).
