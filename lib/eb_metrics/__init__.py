"""EnterpriseBench cross-rig metrics adapters.

Adapter modules that project EB result formats onto shared schemas owned
by other rigs (currently codeprobe's ``TraceQualityReporter``). Each
adapter is a structural projection — no semantic judgment, no hidden
heuristics — so quality reporting stays shape-compatible across rigs
without coupling EB's runner to codeprobe's internals.
