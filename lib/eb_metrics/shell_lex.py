"""A quoting-aware shell lexer, just sufficient to find file reads in a command.

:func:`lex` splits a shell command into :class:`Token` s tagged ``word``,
``op`` (a control operator or redirect), or ``subst`` (the *inner text* of a
``$(...)``/backtick command substitution, for the caller to lex recursively).

The one invariant everything else rests on: **a metacharacter is an operator
only when it is unquoted.** ``shlex`` in posix mode cannot express that — it
strips quotes as it goes, so ``grep '|' f.py`` and ``grep | f.py`` reduce to
the same token stream, and a consumer that splits sub-commands on ``|`` loses
``f.py`` from the first. Keeping the distinction is what lets the caller treat
``(``/``)`` and newline as real separators (recovering subshells and multi-line
commands) without re-opening that hole.

Scope is deliberately narrow. This exists to decide *which tokens are file
arguments to a read command*, so it recognizes quoting, escapes, comments,
control operators, redirects, here-docs, here-strings, and command
substitution — and nothing else. Variable expansion, globbing, aliases, and
arithmetic are not evaluated: a lexer cannot know a filesystem or an
environment, and inventing values it cannot know is how a retrieval metric
starts counting reads that never happened.

Malformed input is *read*, not validated: an unterminated quote or
substitution yields the tokens that completed before it and drops the partial
word. The partial word is dropped rather than emitted because a half-parsed
path is not a path the agent opened.

``bashlex`` was considered and rejected: a third-party runtime dependency in
the scoring path that raises on real-world commands, and a parse failure
falling back to "no reads" would reintroduce exactly the systematic undercount
this module was written to remove (EnterpriseBench-be50).
