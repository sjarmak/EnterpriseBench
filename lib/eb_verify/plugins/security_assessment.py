"""
security_assessment validator — CVE mapping, prioritization fields (stub).

Citations convention (require_grounded_citations=True):
    Citations are gated PER FINDING: each entry in the ``vulnerabilities``
    list must carry a non-empty ``citations`` list, each citation
    ``{"repo": ..., "file": ..., "evidence_span": ...}`` (same schema as
    incident_report/answer). Rationale: unlike those artifacts, a security
    assessment has guaranteed per-claim structure — each vulnerability is an
    independent claim about specific code, and a single top-level citations
    list would let one grounded citation launder N fabricated findings.
    Because the finding itself is the claim, an empty per-finding citations
    list (a claim with zero evidence) fails the gate; this deliberately
    diverges from the top-level convention, where an empty list means "no
    claims" and is trivially grounded. An empty vulnerabilities list has
    nothing to ground and passes.
