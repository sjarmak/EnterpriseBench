"""
Semantic fact coverage as partial-credit retrieval scoring (prototype).

A ground-truth answer for a context-gathering task is decomposed into atomic
*facts* (short natural-language statements about the codebase). An agent's
answer is decomposed the same way. Coverage = recall of GT facts by the
candidate set under cosine similarity of statement embeddings; precision =
fraction of candidate facts grounded in GT (the ungrounded-assertion rate is
``1 - precision``). Adapted from the kge harness ``coverage()`` and the
``dup_of`` provenance pattern in its app.py.

The default embedder is a deterministic TF-IDF over character 3-5-grams
(sklearn), fit per call on the union of GT + candidate statements. No network,
no persisted state. A real embedding model can be plugged in later via the
``Embedder`` Protocol.

Deployment boundary (do not wire into adversarial scoring)
-----------------------------------------------------------
The TF-IDF default is suitable ONLY for cooperative partial-credit recall
(honest agent output, missed-fact detection). Independent verification on
held-out adversarial pairs showed it cannot be trusted where an agent could
game the score: bag-of-ngrams is word-order-blind, so a direction-reversed
relation ("scheduler restarts the worker" vs "worker restarts the scheduler")
scores similarity 1.000; a negated statement scores ~0.956; and a genuine
paraphrase with divergent surface forms can miss at ~0.30 (below the 0.40
operating threshold). Before this module scores anything agents are graded
on, plug a real embedding model in via ``Embedder`` and re-run the
calibration sweep in ``fact_coverage_calibration`` (ideally regrown from
actual task GT facts); a directional/negation post-check on matched pairs is
the cheap alternative mitigation.

Mapping onto lib/eb_verify/scoring.py checkpoints
-------------------------------------------------
``scoring.compute_score`` takes ``CheckpointResult(name, weight, passed,
score)`` items and returns the weight-normalized sum of ``score * weight``.
Fact coverage slots in as follows:

* A *checkpoint* is a cluster of GT facts (e.g. all facts tagged
  ``root-cause``, or all facts about one repo in a multi-repo chain). Tags on
  ``Fact`` carry the cluster key.
* Checkpoint score = ``coverage(cluster_facts, candidate_facts).recall`` —
  the fraction of that cluster's facts recovered. This is exactly the
  0.0-1.0 partial-credit ``score`` field of ``CheckpointResult``.
* ``passed`` = ``recall >= pass_bar`` for the cluster (task-configurable).
* Per-fact provenance (``FactMatch``) goes into ``CheckpointResult.detail``
  so a failed checkpoint names exactly which GT facts were missed and which
  candidate statement came closest.
* An optional extra checkpoint can penalize hallucination:
  ``score = precision(candidate_facts, all_gt_facts).recall``.

Example::

    for cluster_name, cluster in clusters.items():
        cov = coverage(cluster, candidate_facts, threshold=DEFAULT_THRESHOLD)
        results.append(CheckpointResult(
            name=f"facts:{cluster_name}",
            weight=weights[cluster_name],
            passed=cov.recall >= 0.99,
            score=cov.recall,
            detail=cov.provenance_summary(),
        ))
    total = compute_score(results)
