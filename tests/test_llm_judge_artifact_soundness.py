"""Regression tests for LLM-judge artifact discovery + no-output soundness.

Covers two verifier-soundness holes in run_task._apply_llm_judge
(EnterpriseBench-hmcp, audit-2026-06-22 findings #1 and #2):

  Finding #1 (silent_fallbacks): when no agent artifact is found in the
  container, the judge used to ``return scores`` — recording the UN-CAPPED
  grep score as the real Tier-2 measurement. It must instead tag the scores
  with ``verifier_infra_error`` so the run routes to the re-run channel.

  Finding #2 (hardcoded artifact paths): artifact discovery was a baked-in set
  of task-specific repo paths (``/workspace/moby/INCIDENT_REPORT.md`` …). Any
  task whose artifact lives elsewhere (e.g. ``/workspace/BLAST_RADIUS.md``)
  yielded empty output and silently routed into finding #1. Candidate paths
  must be derived from task metadata (instruction.md) instead.
