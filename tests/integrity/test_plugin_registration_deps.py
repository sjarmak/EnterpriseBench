"""fact_triples must be registered only when its heavy deps are actually usable.

The scoring stack (numpy/scikit-learn) is imported lazily so that importers which
never score facts -- above all the chain runner, which reaches this package via
``eb_verify/__init__`` -> ``runner`` -> ``plugins/__init__`` -- do not pay ~0.8s
and ~100MB of TF-IDF machinery at startup.

That deferral silently defeated the old capability probe. The probe registered
FactTriplesValidator unless ``import fact_triples`` raised ImportError; once the
numpy import moved inside the functions that use it, the module imported cleanly
on a numpy-less sandbox, the validator registered, and the deferred ``import
numpy`` blew up later -- inside ``validate()``, at scoring time, where
``runner.py`` calls it with no try/except. Harness breakage destroyed the run
instead of yielding a clean, scoreable record.

These tests pin both halves of the invariant, which pull in opposite directions:
registration must consult the deps explicitly (not as an import side effect), and
the probe itself must not import them. Each runs in a fresh interpreter, because
import state is process-global and numpy is long since imported by the time the
suite reaches this module.
