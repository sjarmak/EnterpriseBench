"""file_extraction under-credit vectors.

The under-credit half of this corpus: a verifier that zeros a correct,
spec-compliant answer books a harness bug as an agent failure. Each vector
asserts the correct 1.0 against an answer that a buggy verifier scored 0.0.
Run as an un-skippable gate (CI), separately from the marker-filtered suite.

Every vector drives the *shipped* check scripts — discovered by content, then
executed through the runner's own ``checkpoint_env`` — rather than restating their
arguments here. An earlier draft restated the scripts' ``--keys`` as a local
constant, so it exercised the module's parsing (never broken) instead of the key
list (the actual bug), and stayed green when the shipped list lost
``code_paths``/``citations``. So the key list appears nowhere below: drop a key from
a check script and these go red.
