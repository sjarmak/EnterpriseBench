"""A verifier that never ran must never be scored — end-to-end (bead glka.2).

These vectors exec the REAL ``scripts/sandbox/test_runner.sh`` with the python3
interpreter genuinely absent from PATH, then route its output through the real
scorer trust boundary. Nothing here is synthetic: the same shell that runs in
the container produces the JSON that the same guard parses.

Two never-ran variants are proven, both of which used to land as a scored 0.0
that was indistinguishable from a genuine wrong answer:

* LOUD   — a bare ``python3`` under ``set -euo pipefail`` exits 127.
* SILENT — ``if python3 ... 2>/dev/null`` swallows the failure, so the verifier
  exits 0 and prints a well-formed ``{"score": 0.0}``. No exit code, no score,
  and no detail string distinguishes it from a real failure.

Two mechanisms, because neither covers the other's ground:

* command_not_found_handle catches a missing command per checkpoint, in any
  context — but ONLY when bash itself performs the PATH lookup. It is blind to
  ``env python3`` and to absolute paths, where the lookup happens in another
  process or not at all.
* The preflight refuses to score the task at all when an interpreter the check
  scripts reference is absent. That closes every invocation form, because no
  verifier runs — but it only knows about interpreters named up front.

The genuine-score controls are the point of the exercise: a wrong answer must
still be a 0.0 and a correct one still a 1.0, or the fix has merely traded a
false-zero problem for a false-infra one. The last section of this file is that
trade caught in the act — an answer the check scripts cannot parse aborts them
mid-flight, and "no verdict" alone cannot tell that apart from a verifier that
never ran. Scored one way, a garbage answer buys the agent a re-run instead of
the 0.0 it earned.
