"""Every source path an answer key cites must exist at the task's pinned rev.

The inverse of the prompt-echo defect (EnterpriseBench-jn73.2.7.3): echo makes a
task gradable without reading the code, while a 404 in the answer key makes it
ungradable no matter how well the agent reads. camel-routing-arch-001 cited

    core/camel-api/src/main/java/org/apache/camel/model/RouteDefinition.java

which does not exist at camel-4.4.0 — RouteDefinition lives in camel-core-model.
An agent that actually opened the file could only ever cite the real path, so the
key graded honest work against a string no honest agent can produce
(EnterpriseBench-c7iik).

Scoped to the tasks whose keys have been path-verified against their pinned rev,
not the whole tree: this asserts a verified fact, and a fleet-wide sweep belongs
in `validate_expected_solutions.py --check-paths`, which flags authoring-time.
Add a task here once its key is verified.
