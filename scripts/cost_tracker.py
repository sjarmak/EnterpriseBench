cost_tracker.py — Report per-task / aggregate costs for EnterpriseBench runs.

Cost has two sources, in order:

tier 1 ("sdk")    Claude Code's per-model ``modelUsage`` block in agent_stdout.log,
                  carrying the vendor's own ``costUSD`` per model. Authoritative.
tier 2 ("trace")  Re-derived from agent_trace.jsonl against the local PRICING
                  table, only when a run has no usable vendor block.

Tier 2 is lossy and cannot be made otherwise: the trace records a single model per
run and carries no sub-agent usage, so a multi-model run cannot be priced correctly
from it however carefully it is summed. Every tier-2 run is named in the report.

Both numbers are computed for every run and their disagreement is published, per
bucket as well as overall — the distortion this module exists to catch is
per-arm, so a blended ratio alone would hide it.
