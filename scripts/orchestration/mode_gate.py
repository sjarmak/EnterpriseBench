"""Filesystem-level enforcement of the ``mcp_only`` tool-access arm.

The arm must vary exactly one thing against baseline: whether the agent can read
repository source from local disk. Two obvious mechanisms both fail:

* A ``--disallowed-tools`` denylist (Read/Grep/Glob/Bash/Task/...) strips the
  agent's shell along with its search tools, so the baseline-minus-mcp_only delta
  would partly measure "lost a shell" rather than "lost local search". It is also
  fail-open: it cannot deny a tool name that does not exist yet.
* Omitting the repos from the image blinds the scorer too, because checkpoints
  score against ``/workspace`` in the same container -- some checks then return 0
  and others award full credit for a missing file.

So the repos stay on disk and the toolset stays identical across every arm; only
the directory permissions differ. The kernel, not an enumerated list, is what
says no, which is why a tool the agent acquires in a future CLI release is gated
too.

Three identities share the container, and the gate has to keep all three intact
(see ``run_task.SCORING_USER`` for the reasoning behind the split):

* ``agent`` runs the agent. Under this gate it must NOT reach repo source.
* ``ebscorer`` runs the checks. It MUST still read the repo source it scores
  against, or the gate would merely relocate the blindness it exists to avoid.
* ``root`` owns everything and is never denied.

Hence ``chown root:ebscorer`` + ``chmod o-rwx``: root owns, the scoring group
reads, and ``agent`` (which is in neither) is "other" and gets nothing. Granting
the scorer *read* rather than *ownership* mirrors how ``_seal_grading_assets``
treats the graders themselves: the scorer may read what it scores, never rewrite
it.

Commands are argv lists, never shell strings: nothing here needs a shell, and a
repo path that reaches a chmod target should not be one quoting bug away from
being reinterpreted as syntax.

    Both halves are load-bearing, and the chown is the half that is easy to talk
    yourself out of:

    * ``chown`` -- the Dockerfile switches to ``USER agent`` *before* it clones
      (``dockerfile_generator`` emits the clone RUNs after that line), so the
      agent starts out as the OWNER of every repo file, and an owner may always
      chmod its own files back. Stripping mode bits without taking ownership away
      leaves a gate the agent can simply undo. Ownership moves to root, and the
      group moves to the scoring group so the scorer keeps the read access the
      checkpoints need.
    * ``chmod o-rwx,g-w`` -- OSS trees are checked out world-readable, so
      re-owning alone would still leave ``agent`` reading through the "other"
      bits. ``o-rwx`` strips those. The group bits are NOT stripped (``go-rwx``
      would blind the scorer instead of the agent), but group *write* is, and
      that half is easy to miss:

      The scorer's access must not change between arms, or the gate has varied
      two things. In an ungated arm the tree is ``agent``-owned and the scorer
      reaches it as "other" -- ``r--`` on files, ``r-x`` on dirs, i.e. read-only.
      Under a container umask of 002 the clone is 0664/0775, so ``chown`` +
      ``o-rwx`` alone would leave the scoring group at ``rw-``, handing the
      scorer write access to the very tree it grades, which it never had in
      baseline. ``g-w`` puts it back to read-only, so the ONE thing this gate
      changes is the agent's access.

    ``/workspace`` itself is deliberately untouched: the agent still has to
    traverse it to reach ``instruction.md`` and to write ``agent_output/``.
    Locking the workspace root would zero the arm instead of gating it.

    Recursion is batched across every path: ``chown``/``chmod`` take many
    operands, so this is one exec each no matter how many repos a task has.
