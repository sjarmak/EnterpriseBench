"""Single source of truth for the flags ``run_benchmark`` forwards to sub-runners.

``run_benchmark.collect_passthrough_args`` emits a fixed set of flags to whichever
runner handles a task's ``session_type`` (``run_task``, ``chain_runner``,
``event_replay``). Every one of those flags must PARSE on the target runner, or
the runner dies at argparse (exit 2) before it can write a result — which
silently disables a whole session_type. Two argparse gaps have each done exactly
that (EnterpriseBench-nw70h: ``--output-dir`` on chain/event_replay and ``--mode``
on event_replay; EnterpriseBench-bl4bc: ``--agent``).

The contract lived as hand-copied ``add_argument`` blocks in each runner, so it
drifted. Declaring it once here — and importing it into every sub-runner —
makes it impossible for the producer to forward a flag a runner rejects.
``PASSTHROUGH_FLAGS`` is the *shape* authority (which flags exist);
``run_benchmark.collect_passthrough_args`` is the *value* authority (how each is
emitted). The contract test (``tests/test_runner_passthrough_contract.py``)
asserts the two stay in sync and that every runner accepts the emitted set.

A runner binds to the contract one of two ways:
  * ``add_passthrough_args(parser)`` — for runners that only forward the flags
    (``chain_runner``, ``event_replay``): every flag is declared accept-and-ignore.
  * ``assert_accepts_passthrough(parser)`` — for a runner that declares the flags
    itself with richer semantics (``run_task``): fail at construction if one is
    missing, rather than as a silent exit-2 at dispatch.
